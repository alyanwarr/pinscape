# Pinscape:
## Location-based mystery game

### Level 1.
#### Game Start: Room 106, A5


You start in a room. You don't remember how you ended up there or why are you here.
You found a phone in your pocket that has a timer displaying 15 minutes.

The message on your phone says: "get to the last point for the ultimate reward,
or lose."

*We can set here a 1st point, such that when a person leaves a room, the timer
starts ticking.*

After the clock starts ticking, the player gets the first hint:

***"You find it where it all begun."***

When reached the zone — 2nd notification with the next hint to the note.

The hint will be like a document (that will tell you something about you)
***List of the participants and rooms. You got to find out who you are.***


1. Mark Zuckerberg -> Room E01
2. Taylor Swift    -> Room E15
3. Elon Musk       -> Room E27
4. Harambe         -> Room E45
5. New Hacker      -> A06, Room 3585( HEX )

### Level 2.

When Room A06, E01 is reached, notification says:

***"You get this for your stuff"***

A person finds a number, that can be changed for a package.
In this package — a hint to a next location.
