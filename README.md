## Location-based mystery game

### Level 1.

You start in a room. You don't remember how you ended up there or why are you here.
You found a phone in your pocket that has a timer displaying 15 minutes.

The message on your phone says: "get to the last point for the ultimate reward,
or lose."

*We can set here a 1st point, such that when a person leaves a room, the timer
starts ticking.*

After the clock starts ticking, the player gets the first hint:

*You find it where it all begun.*

### Level 2.
